Bio: 
Currently a PhD Researcher at EPCC, School of Informatics, at the University of Edinburgh. 
Flic Anderson has been a Research Assistant in Bioinformatics in the Wallace Lab (within the Institute for Cell Biology) at the University of Edinburgh. 
Flic was part of the development team for the 'riboviz' open source software package for processing and analysis of ribosome profiling data, working with colleagues from EPCC (University of Edinburgh) to make the codebase more robust & sustainable.   
With a background in Ecology and Botany (previously a Research Assistant at the Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh), Flic has worked with a wide range of types of biological data using different software tools and programming languages (particularly R) for the last 8 years, and found herself drawn towards bioinformatics and research software engineering. 
Flic is a member of the Edinburgh Carpentries and a certified Carpentries instructor in foundational coding and data science skills for researchers. 

Title: Coding Smart in Academia: Evidence-Based Software Engineering Approaches for High-Quality Research Software Projects

Abstract:  
This project will investigate which effective software engineering approaches (software engineering techniques and development practices) prevalent in traditional software engineering can be recommended to small research software projects to improve their software quality and development efficiency using empirical evidence from mixed methods approaches and novel software quality measurement frameworks

## HOW TO (RE-)USE THIS MATERIAL

This is a `.html` presentation created in `R Markdown` with `ioslides`. 

(It's been written in a [.Rmd](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) file, and I generated .html slides by 'knitting' it in Rstudio.)

You can check out the code used to make these slides at the [Talk repo](https://github.com/FlicAnderson/PhD10moReview) on Github, and adapt it for your own presentations if you like - there's a MIT Licence on the repo, which means: 

*"Basically, you can do whatever you want as long as you include the original copyright and license notice in any copy of the software/source."*

# Coding Smart in Academia: *Evidence-Based Software Engineering Approaches for High-Quality Research Software Projects*  

## Outline 

* Main RQs & project goals 
* What I've achieved so far 
* What I've still to do 
* Challenges for me & the project 
* My Qs. 


## Project Aims

Aims: 
* To develop research software (RS) assessment metrics. 
* To use these in small-scale RS projects to empirically test whether specific software engineering (SE) recommendations improve research software development. 

Goals: develop evidence-basis to guide future researcher-developers in using effective SE approaches in their RS projects.

## Main RQs 

*"Which effective SE approaches\* prevalent in traditional SE can be recommended to small research software projects to improve their software quality and development efficiency?"*

- "How can effectiveness and appropriateness of software engineering techniques and development practices in research software projects be measured? [RSM0]" 
- "Do the identified recommended software engineering techniques or development practices improve the quality of research software and/or development efficiency if deployed within small research software projects? [SEA0]"
- "Which factors influence the adoption and effective use of these recommended software engineering techniques in research software projects? [RSP0]"

\* SE techniques and development practices
